 * What is python-mockup
   python-mockup is a mockup creating tool. 
   here mockup is not the unit testing mockup .. but the gui & work
   flow mockup.

 * Isn't paper and pen good enough !
   If you are sitting face to face with other stake holders , nothing
   will beat a white board or a stack of index cards. However, with
   distributed teams, a virtual white board is needed. There is no 
   free or entrapped white board software which can host apps .. (
   there .. another cool project idea (-:  ) .. so PM is starting it's
   life as an indepdendent app.

 * so what kind of features are planned
   * SCM friendly text file storage
   * Capturing of discussions along with part of screen
   * internal & external flow. 
   * making a slide set 
   * making a test plan 
   
   
 * What exactly will software look like
   * Phase - 1 
     * A text(xml?) file to describe the flow
     * A command line tool read this and generate pdf slides

   * Phase - 2 
     * Either A interactive GUI to manage the XML
     * OR     A html5 interface
